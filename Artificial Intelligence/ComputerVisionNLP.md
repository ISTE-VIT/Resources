# Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers and systems to extract meaningful information from digital photos, videos, and other visual inputs â€” and then act or make suggestions based on that knowledge.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subject of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with computer-human language interactions, specifically how to train computers to process and evaluate huge volumes of natural language data.
