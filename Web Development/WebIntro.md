# Web Development 

Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, 
electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development 
commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

## Backend Web Development

Backend Development is also known as server-side development. It is everything that the users donâ€™t see and contains behind-the-scenes activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It focuses primarily on databases, backend logic, APIs, and Servers.

## Frontend Web Development

Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
